Graphviz.LinuxWrapper implements same functionality than Rubjerg's GraphvizWrapper.

Graphviz.NetWrapper is a VC++ project that handles string marshalling between .NET and Graphviz libary on Windows.

This project achieves same functionality but for Linux.

To compile:
1. Run ./configure
2. make
3. make install

A shared library will be created in your /usr/lib directory called libgraphviz.so which can then be referenced
by AdvancedNutrition.Shared.Linux .NET project.
