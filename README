Graphviz.LinuxWrapper implements same functionality than Rubjerg's GraphvizWrapper.

GraphvizWrapper is a VC++ project that handles string marshalling between .NET
and Graphviz libary on Windows.

The project achieves same functionality but on Linux.

To compile:
1. Run ./configure [--prefix=/destdir]
2. make
3. make install
______________________

A shared library will be created in your /usr/lib directory
called libgraphviz.so which can then be
referenced by the .NET project using P/Invoke.
